# Project Python : Predicts a book's rating

The project consists of predicting the coast of a book through a dataset. 
For this, we must use the "machine learning" system. 
This makes it possible to apply predictive analysis algorithms to different types of data in order to predict the future.

## Download

To download the entire project, you can either download the zip file from github or either use the command `git clone https://github.com/MarjorieMe/ProjectPythonRatingBooks.git`.
